# 🛡️ Hackathon Platform - Rules & User Guide

Welcome to the **Secure Web Code Hackathon Platform**! This guide will help you understand how to participate, earn marks, and use the application effectively.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Sign In**: Log in using your Google account.
2.  **Complete Profile**: You **must** complete your profile (Age, College, Department) before you can access the challenges. This is a one-time setup.

## 📝 The Rules of the Game

### 1. Problem Solving
*   Navigate to the **Problems** page to see all available challenges.
*   Click on a problem to view its description, constraints, and sample inputs/outputs.
*   You can write your solution in **Python**, **C**, or **C++**.

### 2. Running vs. Submitting
There are two ways to test your code:

*   **▶️ Run Code**:
    *   Use this to test your logic against the **Sample Test Cases** (visible).
    *   **Does NOT result in marks.**
    *   Use this freely to debug your solution.

*   **✅ Submit Code**:
    *   Use this when you are confident in your solution.
    *   Your code will be tested against **ALL Test Cases** (including **Hidden** test cases that you cannot see).
    *   **CRITICAL RULE**: You can only submit code that passes **100%** of the test cases.
    *   If your code fails *even one* hidden test case, the submission will be **rejected**, and you will not get any points.

### 3. Scoring System 🏆
*   **All or Nothing**: Marks are awarded ONLY for fully correct solutions.
    *   ✅ Pass all test cases = **Full Marks** (e.g., 25 points).
    *   ❌ Fail any test case = **0 Points** (Submission rejected).
*   **No Partial Marking**: There are no points for passing "some" test cases.
*   **Leaderboard**: Candidates are ranked by their **Total Score**. Solving more problems places you higher on the leaderboard.

## 🚫 What Will NOT Earn Marks
*   **Incomplete Submissions**: Code that works on sample cases but fails hidden edge cases.
*   **Profile Completion**: Filling out your details is mandatory but carries no marks.
*   **Fastest Time**: Speed of submission suggests tie-breaking in some events, but currently, strictly **Score** determines your rank.

## 🔍 Tips for Success
1.  **Read Constraints**: Ensure your code handles the maximum input sizes specified in the problem description.
2.  **Test Edge Cases**: Consider minimum/maximum values, empty inputs, or negative numbers depending on the problem.
3.  **Check Hidden Cases**: If your "Run" works but "Submit" fails, your logic likely misses a specific edge case covered by the hidden tests.
